It was exciting to tweet that because it is exciting! Now that we can add significant features to Drupal in <a href="http://semver.org/">minor releases</a> it's a new world.

Certainly you know how much work goes into building a large open-source project like Drupal. Probably you also know that some of this work happens in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/sprints">sprints</a>. It follows logically that we will be
<a href="https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sprints">sprinting again</a> at DrupalCon next week in Baltimore. And we are. Here's the thing:

## We need your help.

"We" as in "the Drupal community", or "we" as in "Drupal itself", need your help.

There are about <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?text=&assigned=&submitted=&project_issue_followers=&status[0]=1&status[1]=13&status[2]=8&priorities[0]=300&categories[0]=1&version[0]=8.x&issue_tags_op=%3C%3E&issue_tags=Triaged%20D8%20major&&order=last_comment_timestamp&sort=asc">500</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2474049">untriaged</a> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/issue-priority#major-bug">major</a> bugs in Drupal core right now. <em>Triage</em> in this context is the process of evaluating an issue to determine things like: Is this still a bug? For an eloquent description of the issue triage and its importance, see the following:

  * <a href="http://xjmdrupal.org/blog/triage-majors-at-camps">Help triage major bugs at the Florida DrupalCamp or your local camp (yes, you!)</a>
  * <a href="http://xjmdrupal.org/blog/drupal-8-major-triage-new-orleans">Join the Drupal 8 major triage at DrupalCon New Orleans</a>

If you read the articles above, you learned that major triage sprints have been great successes with over 200 issues assessed in 2016. I have led a few triage sprints before and I plan to do it again in Baltimore. First-time sprinters are <em>encouraged</em> to participate. Sprint mentors are needed too. Please join us.
